# GraphQL Stack Explanation

A visual explanation of how the various tools in the GraphQL ecosystem fit together.

I think GraphQL can be confusing, especially to newcomers, because of the large number of tools & libraries available for it. This chart aims to help folks see how the various pieces are connected. I've included the major players, but it's not an exhaustive list - feel free to contribute any omissions.
